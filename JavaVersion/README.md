This Java version was built back in 2012 using the LWJGL as a 3D engine.. bit overkill but it accepted user input and had a programmable 3D environment.

I guess I also lost the source at some point in time. Feel free to reverse engineer it to figure out exactly what I did... but it'll probably take less time to just build one youself ;)
